## How to contribute

First of: thanks for considering creating a contribution! We appreciate it, no matter how small, all contributions matters to the overall result.

Please read through the following to understand how to contribute in a manner that is most likely to be accepted.

### Support questions

Please don't use the issue tracker for support questions. The issue tracker is a tool
to address bugs and feature requests.

For now support via the regular INFO-Subscription support channels is the only way to get help.


### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/infosoftas/s4-orders-js-sdk/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/infosoftas/s4-orders-js-sdk/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
