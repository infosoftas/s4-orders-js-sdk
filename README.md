# INFO-Subcription Orders SDK

This repository contains code for the Orders SDK usable to add orders for Tenants within INFO-Subscription using the simplified Orders API.

## Usage

For usage and configuration options, see the [SDK README](/orders-module/README.md) in the `orders-module` folder.

## Samples

To make it a bit easier to get started we have included two minor samples.
They are just samples and should not be used for anything else than prototyping and learning!

- [Simple Order App](/simple-orders-app/README.md)
- [App With ADB2C Signin](/sample-order-with-user-signin/README.md)
